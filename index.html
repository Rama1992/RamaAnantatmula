            <p>Hi!! I am Rama. I am born and raised in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry">Rajahmundry</a>.
                I have completed my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and worked for a IT company for nearly 5 years.
                During this period,I have gained real time experience on how software companies works, how projects are delivered,
                to deal and meet the expectations of clients and to work with a team. This journey has also given me friends and memories to cherish.
                I moved to Omaha in March 2019 after marrying a Nebraska resident in Hindu wedding ceremony style. In my 6 months of stay in Omaha, I felt a resemblance between Omaha and Rajahmundry. Both these places are a little away from fast paced city lifestyle, people are very friendly, lots of greenery everywhere, a river that divides two places and a bridge that connects them.
                Far away from my home, I found a home in Omaha.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing MS in Management Information Systems in <a href = "https://www.unomaha.edu/">University of Nebraskra Omaha</a>. Its established in 1908 and is one of the most prestigious universities in USA. It has two campuses - Dodge and Scott campus and one of the best libraries - "Criss Library". Students from different parts of the world have joined UNO. Interacting and studying with people from different cultural backgrounds is a new and enriching experience.
               For the new students to get familiar with the campus and the city <a href ="https://www.unomaha.edu/news/events/durango-days.php"> Durango Days </a> were conducted where we as students had free food, live music, fun events and loads of freebies.
                These events helped the students make new friends and get used to the campus. </p>
